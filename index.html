    <h1>Prashant Paneru</h1>
    <p>A Developer</p>
  </div>

  <div class="intro">
    <p>Yo! My name is Prashant Paneru. I am a self-taught and ambitious individual at the age of 18, with 2 years of
      experience as a backend developer in Python and expertise in Django. I am currently expanding my knowledge and
      skills by learning data structures and algorithms, and actively seeking a paid internship opportunity to further
      develop my skills, gain professional experience, and apply my abilities in a real-world setting. I am particularly
      interested in remote and flexible internships that will allow me to work from any location and manage my own
      schedule, as I believe it will be vital for my professional growth. I am confident that my skills, experience,
      passion for technology, and my eagerness to learn more will make me a valuable asset to any team. I am a very
      serious, hardworking, and ambitious individual willing to put all my efforts to become a better developer.</p>

        <h5>Cricket Score tracker</h5>
        <img src="cric.png" alt="Project 1">
        <p>
          Coded a cricket score tracker using pure Python, specifically designed to keep track of scores during
          friendly cricket matches with my friends. This comprehensive tool offers a range of features, including the
          ability to track strike rate, run rate, economy, required run rate, and much more. By simply inputting the
          events of each ball, the tracker automatically updates and records all relevant statistics. It even accounts
          for completed overs and provides a comprehensive overview of the game's progress. With this score tracker,
          managing and analyzing cricket scores has never been easier or more efficient.

        <p>
          I have developed a personal blogging web application that allows users to create and publish various types of
          content. This dynamic platform includes essential features such as a comment section and more. To enhance its
          functionality, I integrated an API using Django Rest Framework, enabling seamless communication between the
          front-end and back-end components. With this innovative web app, users can share their thoughts, engage in
          discussions through comments, and enjoy a user-friendly experience while managing their content.

        <p>
          I created a Django-based social media web application that allows users to perform various CRUD operations.
          The application also features a commenting system, which allows users to interact with one another.
          Additionally, the application has a robust user authentication system that ensures that only authorized users
          can access the platform. The web application is designed for opinion posting, allowing users to express their
          thoughts and ideas on various topics.
